              <h3>Create Your Goals</h3>
              Let's say you want to work on your Spanish, get better at running, and connect with friends better. Your goals would be:
              <div>Practice Spanish</div>
              <div>Run 1 Mile</div>
              <div>Get Dinner with old Friend</div>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
              <h3>Decide How Often</h3>
              These goals don't require the same amount of effort to be successful. Some should be completed more often than others. After thinking about what you want to acheive, you come up with the following.
              <div>Practice Spanish: 1 time per day</div>
              <div>Run 1 Mile: 3 times per week</div>
              <div>Get Dinner with old Friend: 2 times per month</div>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <h3>Mark off Completions</h3>
            When you complete the goal, click the box to mark it off. You get credit for each completion. But if you don't finish what you set out to complete in the time frame you chose, you go back down to zero. Don't let this happen.
