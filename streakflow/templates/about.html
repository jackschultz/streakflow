        Everyone knows that practice makes perfect. The problem is that keeping the motivation, especially when it's difficult to see the positive effects instantly, makes achieving your goals hard. Streakflow makes it easy. By creating manageable goals, and tracking consecutive completions, you're able to see how easy it is to succeed every day. <b>And once you start streaking, you won't want to stop</b>.

          <h2>Variable Length Timeframes</h2>
          <p>
            Some tasks take longer to do, and some shouldn't be done everyday. Even so, they're still important to get done on a regular basis. Use daily, weekly and monthly time frames when necessary.

          <h2>Multiple Completions per Timeframe</h2>
          <p>
            Sometimes, you may want to complete a goal more than once in a timeframe. With StreakFlow, you're able to decide how many times during your selected timeframe you need for it to be considered successful. As long as you know your goals are beforehand, you'll still keep the streak.

          <h3>Step 3: Don't stop; keep streaking</h3>
          Watch as your consecutive days' completed streak grows bigger. Your only goal now is to not have it go back to 0. Skipping one frame makes it easier to skip the next. Keep working.
