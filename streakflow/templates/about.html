        Everyone knows that practice makes perfect. The problem is that keeping the motivation, especially when it's difficult to see the positive effects instantly, makes achieving your goals hard. Streakflow makes it easy. By creating manageable goals, and tracking consecutive completions, you're able to see how easy it is to succeed every day. <b>And once you start streaking, you won't want to stop. <a href="{%url 'registration_register'%}">Register now</a></b>.
